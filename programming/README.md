#RHINO Calf - Programming
This tutorial/building block covers the fundementals of programming the RHINO computing devices - the ARM CPU and the Xilinx FPGA.

## Programming the ARM CPU


## Programming the Xilinx FPGA
1) Creating the FPGA Design (*.bit)
 
1.1) Create a new project in Xilinx ISE with a single VHDL file as the top level entity. Set the target device as XC6SLX150T and the package as FGG676.
1.2)
